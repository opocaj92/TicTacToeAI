#TicTacToe AI

A simple web version of the famous Tic Tac Toe game with a simple (but yet unbeatable?) AI as opponent.

It's written using HTML5+CSS3 for the UI and pure JavaScript (no framework) for the core of the game. The AI it's made using a MiniMax algorithm (good for zero-sum game like tic tac toe) that check every possible solution (they are only few, so controlling all of them don't make the decision process slow, but make the AI unbeatable).
