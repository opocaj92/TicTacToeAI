#TicTacToeAI

##A simple web version of the TicTacToe game with a simple AI as opponent.

###How it works
It's written using HTML5+CSS3 for the UI and pure JavaScript (no framework) for the core of the game. The board is represented with an HTML table, and each cell has an unique ID. When it's clicked, it triggers an event that lets the computer compute its move. The AI it's made using the MiniMax algorithm (good for zero-sum game like TicTacToe) that checks for the best move in the search tree.
