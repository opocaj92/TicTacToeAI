#TicTacToeAI

##A simple web version of TicTacToe with an AI

###How it works
It's written using HTML5+CSS3 for the UI and pure JavaScript (no framework) for the logic of the game. The board is represented with an HTML table, and each cell has an unique ID. When one is clicked, it triggers an event that lets the computer decide its move. The AI it's made using the MiniMax algorithm (good for zero-sum game like TicTacToe) that checks for the best move in the search tree (the AI is therefore unbeatable).
